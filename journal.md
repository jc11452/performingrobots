### Character Design: The Best-Friend
For the character design, we envisioned a stereotypical Malibu girl with an extravagant and exaggerated sense of style—everything from her body shape to her nails and eyelashes is over the top. While the design may evolve as we continue developing it, our current concept features a pronounced hourglass figure with wide hips, a small waist, long legs, and a small face. We were torn between making her really creative, drawing inspiration from RuPaul’s Drag Race fashion, or keeping her design simple and stereotypical to match her personality. In the end, we chose the latter. For proportions, we decided on legs measuring 85cm, a bust of 30cm, and a neck and head totaling 35cm, all within an overall height of 150cm.

### Building the Base: Part01 - TBC
The base structure is essentially a cube that tapers into a prism-like shape. To be honest, we didn’t really think ahead—we treated this assignment as separate from the next step, which definitely made things harder for ourselves moving forward. We started by finding cardboard boxes and cutting along the edges to create two wider rectangles for the front and back pieces, and two thinner rectangles for the sides of the cube. Each cardboard rectangle took a lot of time to reinforce. We cut smaller, thinner rectangular strips and layered them so that the corrugation ran perpendicular to the cardboard underneath. We then overlaid all the pieces, paying extra attention to the folded areas of the base rectangles. Overall, we were incredibly successful in creating very solid and robust base cubes.

### Building the Base: Part02 - COMPLETE
Before cutting out the prism shapes, we decided to connect all the panels together first to make the structure more stable and easier to figure out the positioning of the prism elements. We started by attaching the front and side panels, using a small square piece of cardboard at the bottom to ensure the two panels were at a right angle. After that, we reinforced the connection with tape, and then used a glue gun to secure both the outer and inner edges, making sure everything was fully robust. We repeated the same process for the other two panels until we had a complete cube shape.

For the prism section, we were lucky to have plenty of scraps left over from the already reinforced panels, so we just had to cut them to size. We decided on the height since this part would essentially serve as the waist. After cutting out the front piece, we angled it to determine and cut the matching side panel. Similar to how we constructed the base rectangular panels, we glued the front and side pieces together. However, we quickly realized that because these angled pieces were reinforced, they created small gaps when joined, which caused the heights to become uneven. To fix this, we flipped the other two sides inside out so that the reinforced layers faced outward, allowing the pieces to align more accurately. This wouldn’t be a major issue since the entire structure would later be covered with fabric, hiding any visible seams. Once the prism was properly formed, we roughly cut out a square lid for the waist section and glued everything together—of course, adding plenty of tape as an extra precaution.

Finally, once everything was assembled, we were still obsessed with reinforcing the structure. We went inside the base, and from cutting the angled prism waist pieces, we luckily had plenty of leftover triangles. We used those to reinforce the cube first and then later the prism. Since the pieces weren’t cut exactly to size—because of the angled shape—we just pushed the triangles in until they slotted neatly into place and then glued everything down. With all the reinforcing and layering we had done, the base ended up being quite heavy.

### Installing the Motor: Part01 - TBC
We needed to install a motor at the waist because one of the character’s mannerisms would be a sassy twisting motion—almost like tossing her hair back. However, we also had to consider that this motor would need to support the entire upper body, including the arms and headpiece, which would be quite heavy once reinforced. This meant we had to use a larger, more powerful motor. We couldn’t simply attach the motor directly to the flat square lid of the prism, as that would be unreliable and could compromise the structure’s integrity. To solve this, we cut two flat wooden panels slightly smaller than the square lid. One panel was glued inside the base body, and the other was glued on top of the lid’s outer surface, creating a sturdy foundation for attaching the motor to the lower body.

Once again, one of our biggest mistakes—and another example of how we failed to think ahead—was attaching the square lid onto the prism too early. Considering the next step involved drilling and screwing the motor in place, our lives would have been so much easier if we had just waited to attach the lid until after all the drilling was done. Unfortunately, by the time we realized this, it was too late—the lid had been glued on so thickly that we couldn’t cut or tear it off without damaging the entire structure.

### Connecting the Lower Body to the Wheel Base: Part01 - TBC
Today’s work was by far the most difficult and exhausting—probably because we were trying to figure everything out ourselves instead of asking the professor for help. A lot of things didn’t go as planned. We needed to attach the lower body to the moving wheel base, but since the lower body was slightly larger than the wheel base, we cut two 50cm wooden rods—just a bit longer than the base—to act as supports. The main problem was that we weren’t confident using the drill. We were used to drilling holes for nuts and bolts, but not for screws, and we were too nervous to follow through with it. It also ended up being really time-consuming, so we decided to move on to the motor instead, especially since we were even less confident about that part and needed the professor’s supervision. Attaching the lower body to the wheel base will continue after fall break, before class.

### Installing the Motor: Part02 - COMPLETE
Attaching the actual motor to the board was an absolute nightmare—honestly, a massive pain in ways I can’t even fully express. We spent so long on this part, and after so many slip-ups, we were slowly losing it. Drilling the large hole for the motor’s central rod was the easy part. The real struggle was drilling the two smaller holes that needed to line up perfectly with the bolt holes on the motor. And of course, because we didn’t ask the professor for help, we ended up making our lives unbelievably difficult. To mark where to drill, we colored the backs of the motor’s bolt holes and pressed them against the wood like a stamp. It didn’t work perfectly, but it gave us a rough guide. Since it was the first hole, a little imprecision was manageable.

Once we drilled it, we tried to screw the bolt through the wooden panel and into the motor—but because the hole was exactly the same size as the bolt, it was ridiculously hard to fit it through. To make matters worse, we had already glued on the square lid, which meant we had to climb inside the lower body to line up the bolts. It was cramped, dark, and stuffy—basically impossible to see what we were doing. To double-check if everything aligned, we had to fit the motor inside the lower body and screw from the outside, repeating this over and over. The second bolt hole was even worse, since it had to be drilled with much more precision and left no room for error. This entire ordeal took up the rest of the class time. Ironically, we later realized that instead of struggling to drill perfect placements for the holes, we could’ve just drilled slightly larger holes to make screwing easier, then used nuts and washers to secure the motor in place.
