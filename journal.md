### Character Design: The Best-Friend
<img height="370" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-12 at 4 31 09 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8dff471-0025-4ce1-9189-5806a0bbff39" />

For the character design, we envisioned a stereotypical Malibu girl with an extravagant and exaggerated sense of style—everything from her body shape to her nails and eyelashes is over the top. While the design may evolve as we continue developing it, our current concept features a pronounced hourglass figure with wide hips, a small waist, long legs, and a small face. We were torn between making her really creative, drawing inspiration from RuPaul’s Drag Race fashion, or keeping her design simple and stereotypical to match her personality. In the end, we chose the latter. For proportions, we decided on legs measuring 85cm, a bust of 30cm, and a neck and head totaling 35cm, all within an overall height of 150cm.

### Building the Base: Part01 - TBC
The base structure is essentially a cube that tapers into a prism-like shape. To be honest, we didn’t really think ahead—we treated this assignment as separate from the next step, which definitely made things harder for ourselves moving forward. We started by finding cardboard boxes and cutting along the edges to create two wider rectangles for the front and back pieces, and two thinner rectangles for the sides of the cube. Each cardboard rectangle took a lot of time to reinforce. We cut smaller, thinner rectangular strips and layered them so that the corrugation ran perpendicular to the cardboard underneath. We then overlaid all the pieces, paying extra attention to the folded areas of the base rectangles. Overall, we were incredibly successful in creating very solid and robust base cubes.

### Building the Base: Part02 - COMPLETE
<img height="370" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-12 at 4 35 09 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/264f8e96-3c34-4bcf-b83d-c81b1dacc8a2" />

Before cutting out the prism shapes, we decided to connect all the panels together first to make the structure more stable and easier to figure out the positioning of the prism elements. We started by attaching the front and side panels, using a small square piece of cardboard at the bottom to ensure the two panels were at a right angle. After that, we reinforced the connection with tape, and then used a glue gun to secure both the outer and inner edges, making sure everything was fully robust. We repeated the same process for the other two panels until we had a complete cube shape.

For the prism section, we were lucky to have plenty of scraps left over from the already reinforced panels, so we just had to cut them to size. We decided on the height since this part would essentially serve as the waist. After cutting out the front piece, we angled it to determine and cut the matching side panel. Similar to how we constructed the base rectangular panels, we glued the front and side pieces together. However, we quickly realized that because these angled pieces were reinforced, they created small gaps when joined, which caused the heights to become uneven. To fix this, we flipped the other two sides inside out so that the reinforced layers faced outward, allowing the pieces to align more accurately. This wouldn’t be a major issue since the entire structure would later be covered with fabric, hiding any visible seams. Once the prism was properly formed, we roughly cut out a square lid for the waist section and glued everything together—of course, adding plenty of tape as an extra precaution.

Finally, once everything was assembled, we were still obsessed with reinforcing the structure. We went inside the base, and from cutting the angled prism waist pieces, we luckily had plenty of leftover triangles. We used those to reinforce the cube first and then later the prism. Since the pieces weren’t cut exactly to size—because of the angled shape—we just pushed the triangles in until they slotted neatly into place and then glued everything down. With all the reinforcing and layering we had done, the base ended up being quite heavy.

### Installing the Motor: Part01 - TBC
<img width="600" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-12 at 4 37 06 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57582ab2-725b-471c-8b8b-9ad30c1cc92a" />

We needed to install a motor at the waist because one of the character’s mannerisms would be a sassy twisting motion—almost like tossing her hair back. However, we also had to consider that this motor would need to support the entire upper body, including the arms and headpiece, which would be quite heavy once reinforced. This meant we had to use a larger, more powerful motor. We couldn’t simply attach the motor directly to the flat square lid of the prism, as that would be unreliable and could compromise the structure’s integrity. To solve this, we cut two flat wooden panels slightly smaller than the square lid. One panel was glued inside the base body, and the other was glued on top of the lid’s outer surface, creating a sturdy foundation for attaching the motor to the lower body.

Once again, one of our biggest mistakes—and another example of how we failed to think ahead—was attaching the square lid onto the prism too early. Considering the next step involved drilling and screwing the motor in place, our lives would have been so much easier if we had just waited to attach the lid until after all the drilling was done. Unfortunately, by the time we realized this, it was too late—the lid had been glued on so thickly that we couldn’t cut or tear it off without damaging the entire structure.

### Connecting the Lower Body to the Wheel Base: Part01 - TBC
Today’s work was by far the most difficult and exhausting—probably because we were trying to figure everything out ourselves instead of asking the professor for help. A lot of things didn’t go as planned. We needed to attach the lower body to the moving wheel base, but since the lower body was slightly larger than the wheel base, we cut two 50cm wooden rods—just a bit longer than the base—to act as supports. The main problem was that we weren’t confident using the drill. We were used to drilling holes for nuts and bolts, but not for screws, and we were too nervous to follow through with it. It also ended up being really time-consuming, so we decided to move on to the motor instead, especially since we were even less confident about that part and needed the professor’s supervision. Attaching the lower body to the wheel base will continue after fall break, before class.

Attaching the actual motor to the board was an absolute nightmare—honestly, a massive pain in ways I can’t even fully express. We spent so long on this part, and after so many slip-ups, we were slowly losing it. Drilling the large hole for the motor’s central rod was the easy part. The real struggle was drilling the two smaller holes that needed to line up perfectly with the bolt holes on the motor. And of course, because we didn’t ask the professor for help, we ended up making our lives unbelievably difficult. To mark where to drill, we colored the backs of the motor’s bolt holes and pressed them against the wood like a stamp. It didn’t work perfectly, but it gave us a rough guide. Since it was the first hole, a little imprecision was manageable.

Once we drilled it, we tried to screw the bolt through the wooden panel and into the motor—but because the hole was exactly the same size as the bolt, it was ridiculously hard to fit it through. To make matters worse, we had already glued on the square lid, which meant we had to climb inside the lower body to line up the bolts. It was cramped, dark, and stuffy—basically impossible to see what we were doing. To double-check if everything aligned, we had to fit the motor inside the lower body and screw from the outside, repeating this over and over. The second bolt hole was even worse, since it had to be drilled with much more precision and left no room for error. This entire ordeal took up the rest of the class time. Ironically, we later realized that instead of struggling to drill perfect placements for the holes, we could’ve just drilled slightly larger holes to make screwing easier, then used nuts and washers to secure the motor in place.

We lost the wooden pieces the professor had cut for us, along with the motor, so Clara went to the scene shop first thing in the morning to recut everything. By the time I returned, the wooden shafts had been cut, including the cardboard flaps for the hands, so I started assembling all the parts. I marked the holes for the motor mount, drilled them, and used a nut and bolt to secure the motor firmly in place. To attach the wooden shafts to the motor horn, I hot-glued the horn onto the wood just above the groove so it would stay aligned before drilling through and fastening it with a screw. The process was fairly simple and repetitive. Once everything was secured, we slid the cardboard hands into the grooves, connected the wires to pins 18 and 16 on the Arduino board, tested the code to confirm it worked, and that was it. We were done with the hand motors.

## Friday 28th November 2025
Today was focused on reorganizing the cases and filling in the empty action gaps. From previous rehearsals, we noticed that there were many dialogue moments where our robot wasn’t doing anything, which made her feel a bit lifeless. So we brainstormed how to use our remaining actions to make her movements feel more active and intentional. One of the main additions was the hand-snapping motion. It fit naturally into the texting scene, where the best friend is typing messages to the wife on the husband’s behalf. By reorganizing and adding more actions, it also became clearer which motors and movements were still missing. We also needed to make sure the action timing aligned with the dialogue, so we added a lot of delay() functions to keep everything synchronized and harmonious. However, during the case run-throughs, we noticed the hand motor kept falling off again, which was incredibly frustrating because it happened constantly without any pause. Every time we pressed it back on, it would fall off again during the very next hand movement. This is something we need to fix as soon as possible.

Today was finally the day we properly fixed the hand motor. We’d been struggling with the hand constantly falling off, and after getting help from the professor and his diagrams, we were determined to resolve the issue once and for all. We found the shortest 3 mm bolts available and began fixing the issue. I drilled a hole in the center of the horn attached to each wooden shaft. Because it was plastic on top of wood, drilling a straight line was difficult—the drill would often veer off at an angle. On the second wooden piece, I managed to get the bolt through the wood and screwed into the motor’s center with little resistance because that angle happened to be straighter. However, for the first motor, I realized the bolt was too short to actually reach the motor’s center, and using a longer bolt would have caused too much wobbling between the wood and the motor. 

The professor advised us to drill a full hole all the way through the wooden shaft, wide enough for the bolt head to pass through. From there, we would simply screw it in and secure everything using the tiny bolts that originally came with the motor (which we eventually found in the professor’s office). This step was extremely difficult. I had to attach the bolt to the screwdriver before inserting it, and because the bolt was going into a deep hole, I couldn’t see anything inside, which made it hard to aim for the motor’s center. Most of the time, the bolt would go in at an angle without me realizing it, and I would unknowingly be trying to screw into a flat surface. It took a lot of tedious trial and error, but eventually, I managed to fasten the bolt securely into the motor’s center.

We finished soldering the Neopixels today, which took a very long time and required a lot of redoing. Wires soldered during the previous session kept detaching, and because the spaces between the solder points were so small, reheating one connection often melted the solder on the adjacent wire. As a result, fixing one wire usually meant having to redo two or even three. After we cut out 4 rectangular openings for the eyebrows, 2 for default brows (the bottom row) and 2 for raised brows (the top row). After that, we inserted the Neopixels behind these openings. We were extremely anxious pushing the Neopixels through the holes because we were worried the wires might detach again, especially where the wires were pressed into the tight perpendicular edge of the cardboard. To prevent anything from shifting, we secured each Neopixel firmly in place with multiple vertical strips of tape.

## Wednesday 3rd December 2025

<img height="370" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-12 at 7 10 03 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5e03446-908a-43ab-9238-767efafa25e7" />

Today's focus was on programming the Neopixels. There was a lot of trial and error involved. We started by using the default Neopixel test code from Arduino just to confirm that the LEDs were functioning. Once that worked, we began adjusting the code to make the eyebrows respond to specific cases. We also wanted to change the eyebrow colors, but during programming we realized that some Neopixels weren’t functioning, specifically the upper right eyebrow. This turned out to be a soldering issue rather than a coding issue; if we pressed the wires tightly in certain spots, the LEDs would temporarily light up before turning off again. Since at least some of the Neopixels were working, we decided to leave the faulty ones for another time.

<img height="370" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-12 at 4 46 18 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca8667af-38aa-4fad-8940-e6f8f1d25b13" />

We also finished pinning the clothes today. Our goal was to complete all the visual elements of her design, so we brought in the silver dress. Because the robot is bulky and shaped in a way that normal clothing can’t fit her without cutting it apart, we chose not to dress her fully. Instead, we pinned the front of the dress directly to the front of the robot. Everything else we planned to paint silver to match. For the upper torso, we covered her shoulders with a blue shawl and added a fur shawl to cover her chest area. We placed a pearl necklace on top and pinned the wig in a way that allowed only the Neopixels to show. Her physical appearance really started coming together—she looked striking and had a dominating presence.

## Sunday 7th December 2025 (D-Day 2)
Clara added the typing sound effect to our dialogue for the texting scene with the wife. We also made the executive decision to use only two functioning eyebrows. The eyebrow LEDs were far too unstable: sometimes all four worked, sometimes only three, and overall they were too unreliable. With the limited time we had left, it made more sense to focus on getting just the bottom two LED strips working consistently. During rehearsal, we realized the LEDs were too bright to be covered by the balding wig, so we decided to cover them with cardboard instead. We didn’t want to risk damaging the LED strip by applying hot glue directly onto it, especially since it could be reused, so we first placed tape over the LED strip and then applied hot glue on top of the tape to secure the cardboard. Finally, we adjusted the code so that the eyebrows remained lit throughout the dialogue and turned off at the appropriate moment when the lines finish. It was relatively easy as we used the delay() command. 

## Monday 8th December 2025 (D-Day 1)
Today was our final rehearsal before D-Day. It started around 8 p.m., and overall things were running smoothly since we had double-checked everything the night before. Because Clara attended the earlier rehearsal but not the evening one (and I was the opposite) I ended up handling both the movement and case activation, which was a bit challenging. During rehearsal, our robot fell forward, literally landing face-down on the floor and knocking its mouth off. I identified two causes for the fall: first, the robot isn’t well-balanced and naturally leans forward, so any small forward jerk makes it likely to tip over. Second, the motor seems faulty. Whenever we try to move slowly, there’s strong resistance unless we push the RC controller to the maximum. But doing so makes the robot surge forward too quickly, and when we stop, it jerks forward abruptly. Because of the fall, the internal wires were messed up, which caused the transmitter controls to stop working. Another issue we discovered as well was that the typing/texting sound effect was far too quiet compared to the voice.

So today was focused entirely on final repairs. Clara redid the typing sound effects and reuploaded them to both the receiver and the transmitter. We also discovered that the eyebrow soldering was still unstable, the wires were fraying and making contact with the other soldered point. We spent a long time on soldering, partly because (simply put) we aren't very good at soldering, but also because the LED placement made the angle extremely difficult. The ends of the LEDs were positioned very close to the perpendicular edge of the cardboard, so holding the wire in place without burning ourselves was a challenge. After the rehearsal, I stayed behind to figure out the transmitter issue. I suspected it was because of the wiring, and after rearranging everything, I tested all the cases to make sure it worked properly. When I brought the robot back to the lab to meet Clara, we decided to zip-tie the wires together to prevent them from becoming tangled again. Since we decided that the robot should move backward and then twist to face forward, we also continued painting the back of the robot silver.

## Tuesday 9th December 2025 (D-DAY!!!)

It was the most hectic, nerve-racking day of any performing-robot class, not because it was the final performance, but because so many things went wrong while we were racing against time to fix everything. It felt especially chaotic because Clara and I knew we tended to have bad luck, so we double, triple-checked our work the night before. Still, during rehearsal, with only 4 hours before the performance, the robot’s arm fell off despite having been screwed on. Clara and I scrambled to reattach the arm with a glue gun, cardboard, and scissors. We hot-glued the top of the entire arm to the shoulder base and added a stack of cardboard triangles for extra support, hoping it would hold up just long enough for the performance. Once that problem was fixed, we had to reconnect the wires to their corresponding motors. Since we had zip-tied all the wires together, we ended up connecting them at random and using the cases to test which motors were working, and fortunately that plan worked well enough.

<img height="370" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-12 at 4 24 23 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/433b2a13-28b0-4c0b-b137-fb48e5d3cbd1" />

Once we ran through all the cases and were certain everything was working, including the soldered eyebrows, we turned off the battery for the Arduinos. We were paranoid that the battery might somehow shut off on its own, and we wanted to focus entirely on the motor, since we knew it was our biggest problem. The motor struggled to move forward smoothly and would often jolt when stopping, which threw off the robot’s balance. Because of this, we decided to have it move backward instead, since it performed much better that way, although we still needed more practice.

Out of anxiety, we tested the cases again, but this time the robot kept replaying an error and would not move at all. This gave us the biggest heart attack, because by then we had only an hour left until the performance. After scrambling for 10-15 minutes to find the cause, checking every wire, confirming the batteries were on, and making sure nothing had come loose, we finally decided to reupload our receiver–transmitter code. And thankfully, it worked. I still do not know why reuploading the code fixed the issue, especially since the robot had worked perfectly with the same cases during rehearsal the day before without needing any additional code uploads.

During the actual performance, I think it went better than any of our previous rehearsals, which was a huge relief. There were still moments when I was literally on the edge of my seat, fearing the robot would tip over, especially when we tried to move closer to the microphones on stage because our speaker was taped to the back. It was almost comical how unpredictable the robot was. For example, during rehearsal the eyebrows malfunctioned, and then during the final checks before the performance they suddenly started working again. In the first case that was supposed to trigger both eyebrows, one of them went out, leaving the robot with a single glowing eyebrow that refused to turn off. It was frustrating and honestly jaw-dropping how every time we carefully checked for issues before an important rehearsal or showing, something new would decide to stop working. Regardless, it was definitely an unforgettable class. Considering my skills at the start of the course compared to now, I never would have believed I could help build a functioning robot. The process was tedious and often frustrating, but there were also genuine moments of happiness each time we managed to get something to work. It was truly a memorable and worthwhile class, and I am glad our robot managed to pull through to the end.
